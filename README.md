# Info7390-final
Image Classification Approaches Based on LGBP Feature Extraction
# Image pre-processing
We are using Matlab to get the LGBP features from the images.
You will need to set up a Matlab enviroment, we are using MATLAB_R2018a.
# Image classification
You can use the LGBP features data that we already get in the Race_data folder, then the upcoming steps to classify images by race (white or asian) are in the 'Info7390+final.ipynb' notebook.
